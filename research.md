# Research
I am currently a researcher at **Dr. Wissam Kontarâ€™s lab** at the **University of Nebraska-Lincoln**, focusing on **automated vehicle (AV) behavior analysis based on empirical and simulation data** to improve safety and efficiency in mixed traffic environments.

### Key Topics:
- Empirical Analysis of AV Interaction and Behavior in Urban Mixed Traffic
- Designing Consensus-Aware Automated Vehicles for Urban Mixed Traffic
- Big Data and Smart Data for Traffic Safety
- Machine Learning in Demand Forecasting and Safety Analysis
- Activity Sequencing and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)  

## Past Research
- Integration of Location-Based Service (LBS) Data and Smart Data for Traffic Calibration (*Lincoln, NE*)
- Modeling Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crash Exposure using Location-Based Service Data (*Nebraska DOT*)
- Modeling Driver's Gap Acceptance Behavior Using Empirical Data (*Jordan University of Science & Technology*)
- Superpave Mixtures & Pavement Performance (*Jordan University of Science & Technology*)
