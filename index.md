## Brief Background
I am a PhD student in Civil Engineering at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, with a decade of experience in transportation planning and traffic engineering, including leading roles in Dubai, UAE. My current research focuses on automated vehicle behavior and data-driven safety analysis using machine learning and artificial intelligence. I also serve as a teaching assistant and contribute to collaborative projects in AV-human interaction, traffic safety, simulation and traffic calibration.

Our paper, “Better Safety Analyses through Smarter Data: Adding Open-Street-View and Traffic-Calibrated LBS Data to Pedestrian Crash Analysis in Lincoln, NE”, has just been accepted in the **Transportation Research Record (TRR)**.   
Using a granular grid approach, we integrated StreetLight-calibrated traffic volumes with Mapillary street-view features to model both crash counts and crash severity. The grid-based approach captured fine-scale variations often missed in traditional analyses, while incorporating temporal effects helped account for shifts across post-recession, pre-pandemic, and pandemic years. Together, the models show how traffic activity and street-level features influence not just where crashes occur, but how severe they are, offering scalable, data-driven insights for pedestrian safety planning.
